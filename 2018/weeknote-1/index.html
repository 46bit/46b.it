    <p>Since joining GDS I‚Äôve learned a lot about infrastructure and ways of working like agile and XP. And I‚Äôve contributed a lot back to my team from that. But after 10 months I needed to get some wider context, and see how other teams work. To that end I‚Äôm helping a product team deploy its infrastructure for private beta.</p>

<p>I spent last week starting to understand my new team‚Äôs culture and mission, investigating the project I‚Äôm helping deploy, researching ways of packaging Java/JVM projects for release (e.g., fat JARs), and arranging community things.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/">Queer Code London</a> need a new venue for their Saturday lunchtime coding events, and I‚Äôve been checking that we‚Äôre OK to host it in the GDS office. (We can!)</p>

<p>I went to leaving drinks for Dan and Graham, both of whom were on the PaaS team when I first joined. A bit sad‚Äîboth were fantastic to work with‚Äîand yet lovely to see such experienced people finding new challenges.</p>

<p>I learned from my time on the <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk">GOV.UK PaaS</a> team that structured summary notes are incredibly valuable, so I condensed a lot of historical experimentation into some Markdown notes.</p>

<p>I tried to get this project running on the PaaS, my old team‚Äôs Cloud Foundry platform, but it didn‚Äôt work because the file layout is very odd. There‚Äôs a lot of external policy we have to work with, limiting what we can change.</p>

<p>Shortly after that I changed my approach. I‚Äôm only helping this team for a few weeks, so I shouldn‚Äôt try to Get Things Done or directly make problems disappear. Instead I‚Äôll act like a mentor, boosting the team‚Äôs own confidence with infrastructure. This process has a learning curve for me but is less pressure and quite enjoyable!</p>

<p>I got upset this week, having left my familiar team and feeling a bit out of place in the Ops community. I haven‚Äôt observed the group dynamics enough to understand why it‚Äôs so male, and the last year has taught me to be careful about investing my energy in culture problems.</p>

<p>As ever the small, lunchtime Meditation Club got me through the week. Having people about me for reassurance and wellbeing skills is an utter joy.</p>

        <p><a class="post-title" href="/2021/finding-a-new-job-in-tech/">Finding a new job in tech</a></p>
        
        <!--<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.toby.codes/posts/2021-02-Getting-a-job-in-tech-in-2021">Toby Lorne</a>, I wanted to share about my recent job hunt.</p>

<p>For the last four years I have been an engineer at <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/">Government Digital Service</a> in London. My background is quite varied. At GDS I quickly became a DevOps expert and built, taught and operated infrastructure for <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk">cloud platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk">payment processing</a> and <a href="https://www.verify.service.gov.uk">digital identity</a>.</p>

<p>4 years is a long time to stay in one technology job, even with many different teams and projects. I have contributed to just about every service in GDS, and many elsewhere in government. I decided to find a new challenge elsewhere as my growth had slown down. I want to stay on the technical career track for the time being.</p>

<p>I have moved back to York as I wasn’t enjoying London during the pandemic. Quality of life here is excellent and I’m planning to stay. Remote roles are freely available.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>I applied for senior-level DevOps, SRE and software engineering, roles at these types of organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Government: 1</li>
  <li>Cloud consulting: 1</li>
  <li>Mid- to late-stage startups: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>I got lots of interest from other teams in the Civil Service. I already know I can succeed there, and they already know what I’m capable of. But after 4 years I think it’s important to see somewhere else and keep learning. I ruled out large enterprises for the same reasons. I also ruled out finance for the time being to focus on quality-of-life.</p>

<p>I applied to several startups with problems that interest me. I have past experience with a small Y Combinator startup, and helping grow some larger startups. I’m sure I’ll go back into the startup world sooner or later.</p>

<p>I also interviewed with a cloud consultancy that I’ve known for quite a long time. I haven’t done consultancy before, although I’ve done a lot of freelancing and think consulting might suit me well.</p>

<p>All the roles I applied for were mostly- or fully-remote. This ruled out a few very competitive companies but not anywhere I was desperate to work at yet.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>Here’s a brief summary of how I progressed in the interviews:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Stage</th>
      <th>Passed</th>
      <th>Rejected</th>
      <th>Withdrew</th>
    </tr>

      <td>Offer</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I got responses from every application and ended up with two offers. I withdrew one application when I decided not to stay in government, and a second that was too far behind when I got offers.</p>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<p>I had two offers to choose between: one from a late-stage startup and one from the cloud consulting company. Both were quite appealing and I was confident I’d grow from both.</p>

<p>I chose based on my favourite work. On <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk">GOV.UK PaaS</a> I have found myself helping services across government by solving incidents or advising on architecture. Consulting is a great way to get similar exposure in the private sector.</p>

<p><strong>Thus I’m excited to be joining <a href="https://www.engineerbetter.com">EngineerBetter</a> in early April to do cloud consulting and help transform companies.</strong></p>

<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>

<p>I have a bunch of education and skills, but it felt terrible having a really good time during a pandemic that has hurt so many people.</p>

<p>Every company respected that I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they/them</code> pronouns. I was very happy about this. Companies seem to be well into adjusting to the existence of non-binary staff.</p>

<p>It’s getting harder to find pure-technical roles that I think will challenge me. I’m not sure what to do after Senior, but sooner or later I’m going to be writing a lot less code and doing a lot more negotiation and planning.</p>

<p>Asking difficult <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>-style Computer Science puzzles seems quite rare outside of finance, enterprise and Silicon Valley startups. These problems test abstract thought, but they also exclude people without a Computer Science education. I didn’t encounter any problems that I couldn’t solve.</p>

<p>Finding fully- or mostly-remote jobs was very easy. I’m no longer in London and don’t want to travel there every day. This was not a problem for any organisation I talked to. There’s some selection bias here in terms of the company culture that appeals to me. Remote salaries were quite similar to what I’d have targeted in London.</p>

<p>Having deep experience of both development and operations is extremely valuable right now. I wasn’t very surprised to receive multiple offers. I think I got bonus points for having taught infrastructure a lot in my current role.</p>

<p>Interviewing at Senior level feels easier than early-career. Expectations are higher but I have a lot of confidence and many deep experiences to draw on. I also have a bigger network for referrals and to ask questions. I imagine Staff level would still be hard.</p>

<p>Companies do a lot of interview stages. I had 20+ videocalls over two weeks. Scheduling these was very draining despite even though most companies have worldwide interviewers available at any convenient time. In hindsight I wished to have taken time off to find a new job.</p>

<p>Private sector salaries are much higher than government, yet Civil Service pensions are very valuable. Focusing on pensions doesn’t work for London’s housing market and that pushes a lot of people away.</p>

<p>Today I’m discussing what we owe to each other and what we owe to ourselves. In particular, how responsible are we for the feelings of others?</p>

<p>One school of thought is that we are entirely responsible. In this world we are wholly responsible for how our messages are received. Another model is that we are not responsible at all: we are responsible for nothing more than our intent. These are two extremes.</p>

        <p><a class="post-title" href="/2018/counterintuitive-leadership-growth/">The counterintuition of how leaders grow</a></p>
        
        <!--<p>My background is in small organisations: some fast-moving startups, but also some slower-moving organisations like research councils. Since I joined GDS I’ve been getting used to a larger organisation. A big part of that for me has been recognising how important leaders become in organising a large group of people. But a big part of that has been seeing how much help or harm leaders can do.</p>

<p>GDS has shown me people who I look up to a lot. Leaders who treat people with respect, are keen to grow people around them, and yet can manage effectively and see their team deliver lots. A lot of them are LGBTQ, or not male, and these traits definitely go along with forms of servant-ish leadership I appreciate.</p>

<p>My naive assumption for a long time was that these people were so brilliant because they’d learned it in equally brilliant, safe conditions. And yet from listening to them I’ve realised that isn’t true at all.</p>

<p>Wonderful leaders seem to have learned from failure. Even to have ‘born’ in failure. Many of the leaders I admire started leading in difficult situations that made them feel overresponsible, unsupported and unhappy.</p>

<p>My past has lots of examples where selfishness seemed to lead people to power who were intended to abuse it. I’m a believer that the best leaders are those who aren’t self-centered and wouldn’t seek power for themselves.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t necessarily look so straighforward in the real world. Many people, such as those in marginalised groups or who don’t try to project masculine-style confidence, don’t get offered chances that they obviously are capable of attempting. So getting that eventually requires some sort of opening.</p>

<p>I talked about this at length with some very experienced people. Their response was reassuring: that different people are motivated by different things, but that sometimes for anyone to get what they deserve they have to be quite assertive about it. And in particular, that <em>personal ambition is OK.</em> I suspect that will seem obvious to many readers, and it might feel frightening that I’m suggesting otherwise, but chat with me sometime.</p>

<p>So one can look for leadership opportunities. I’m vaguely convinced now that being ambitious like that is not unhealthily selfish. Finding the sort of vacuum that one can start healing is a matter of luck, but I was taught a new form of trust. If you’re demonstrating skills then you can trust people to start using those skills. Everyone’s doing their best, everyone needs help. And for awhile that’s probably going to be in a way that gives little responsibility but requires lots of engagement, but that’s how you show what you can do. And it’s how you can fail in a low-consequence situation.</p>

<p>So, the counterintuition is: <strong>some of the best and most sensitive and effective leaders actually learned that from bad, insensitive, ineffective situations that they felt determined to fix.</strong></p>

<p>(At this point I realise I’m talking about myself.)</p>

        <!--<p><a href="/2017/finding-london-hard/">In December I wrote</a> about how painful I had found it to leave York, move to London by myself, and start putting this new phase of life together. And this seemed strange, because I was evidently doing well and enjoying work and I did not <em>objectively</em> feel lonely.</p>

<p>I’ve been learning about an area of psychology called attachment theory, and it turns out that people don’t work that way. Something called the Dependency Paradox describes how people without reliable relationships can struggle to feel comfortable in their independence, whereas once those relationships are settled and reliable the same people will be independent and unconcerned. This lack is why I was feeling so upset for a time, but also why things have felt dramatically lighter in recent months.</p>

<h2 id="i-learned-lots-about-leading-in-an-agile-environment">I learned lots about leading in an agile environment</h2>

<p>A difficulty with working at GDS is how exposing collaborative ways of working can be. There are lots of potential triggers, like teams expecting pair programming and not building in ay recharge time. There are lots of things one has to work with, such as being overwhelmed by bright office lights.</p>

<p>I’ve learned to work around these things. Finding recharge time can be a question of seeing yourself as being <em>in</em> the team rather than <em>of</em> it. Bright office lights can be mitigated by polarising sunglasses, and hopefully by something more stylish in time. And I’ve learned a lot along the way.</p>

<p>We seem to learn more from unpleasant experiences than from enjoyable ones. It’s hard to know <em>why</em> something successful works without asking a lot of questions, and some questions risk surfacing lingering issues and creating drama. I suppose that the people we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development#Storming">storm with</a> can become deeply respected and appreciated friends as things normalise.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking to quite a few Delivery Managers and Product Managers, and I shadowed <a href="https://twitter.com/probablyreading">one of my favouritest Delivery Managers</a>. I’m fascinating by the agile team structures that we use, and their deliberate structures. I had always felt that stereotyping people into roles was oppressive, and would be suffocating to roleplay. But these structures work <em>because</em> people divide responsibilities—not because people are necessarily lacking in relevant abilities. With divided responsibilities comes more focus, clearer lines to collaborate along, and thus more effective teams. When you understand your role you <em>can</em> subvert it in ways that work for you (for instance, some Delivery Managers take a keener interest on the Product side of things.)</p>

I’m fascinating by the deliberate structures in our agile teams. These structures seem to work <em>because</em> people divide responsibilities, even though people might not be lacking in skills.</p>

<p>A good example is that Product Managers sometimes need to be “a product arse”—very outspoken in advocating for the product. This could ruin morale or burn the team out, except that other roles are there to speak out for what’s humanly and technically possible. When you can count on the other roles in a team to complement your role, you achieve more together.</p>

<p>GDS ask interviewing Developers about experience of leadership. I kept quiet because it isn’t necessary for mid-level, and I doubted my experiences in smaller orgs with informal leadership was relevant. At this stage: a lot of that was the stereotyped self-doubt that marginalised people get when applying for roles. The missing ingredient in applying my leadership experience to GDS wasn’t “how does one lead?” but “why do we have roles?”</p>

<p>This is all opinion. Much of it is influenced by others; the exact understanding is mine. I think it’s a way forward. As I learn more of my triggers, and keep finding new opportunities to exercise myself in different team situations, I’ll get closer and closer to being a credible tech lead. This might take a long time, but that’s particular to <em>this</em> way of working, and if I wanted I could find a different organisation that I could lead in right now. But GDS’s ways of working care about people, deliver great products, and are worth my effort to learn.</p>

<p>I’ve said all that without mentioning what I’ve actually being doing most of the time! I think I’ll talk about that next time. I’ve done:</p>

Day 1 has some cybersecurity competitions, and a team of 3 of us participated in the Software Development stream.</p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of hackdays—between 16 and 20 I won prizes in at least six of them. I picked up a minimal-product/prototyping mindset, but it was hard to keep going afterwards. Over time my enthusiasm waned. The time limits, intensity and limited feedback hindered stretching my boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>This competition seemed quite interesting because writing Cryptography-related software is hard.</strong> It’s hard to start off in the right direction, and easy to screw up later on. As such having professional feedback on an interesting day of work sounded great.</p>

<p>So, <strong>our task was to build encrypted local partitions.</strong> We had to build a system which stored encrypted keys on USB keys. Inserting such a USB key automatically prompted users to authenticate for a particular key. The encrypted volume was then to be used as a virtual drive.</p>

        <!--<p>I’ve become a fan of developing, “as slowly as possible.” It’s proven hard to crystallise what feelings this sums up, but I relate it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">slow, logical, conscious System Two</a> thinking.</p>

<p>The way you start a project indicates a lot about how it will progress. Something that gets a testsuite early on will probably keep one going; something that is essentially untested is hard to improve. This hill can be climbed over if one is lazy or very disciplined - but sustained effort to undo unforced mistakes is hard.</p>

<p>So making the right decisions at the right time is important. Ideally we should favour sustained velocity over quickly hacking something together and forgetting about it. We should have good craft <em>in order to</em> still move fast: building things well rather than just building them.</p>

<p>My efforts to optimise the process have led me to the curious practice of un-matching: making pairs of socks so as to deliberately <strong>not</strong> be a matching pair. It’s much faster, much simpler to compute and yet because there is a process behind it you have a defence against allegations of laziness.</p>

    <p>Young technologists have a wonderful opportunity to explore. Software is involved in almost every company; <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software ate the world</a>. Whether you’re a software engineer, data scientist or product manager you can work on more-or-less anything.

<p>I love learning. Years ago I wanted to work on everything, learn all I could. For quite a while that was my main career goal. I’ve worked on a huge list of things [1], from Signal Processing to DevOps, Archaeology to Web Development. I’ve worked in startups, academia, government, and enterprise.

<p>There are huge upsides. I have relevant experience for almost all technical job postings. That feels awesome. I can navigate away from difficult problems a long time before they happen. “Your opinions save lives,” to quote some feedback.</p>

<p>The downside is time. It’s harder to count years of experience when you were doing radically different things from year to year. If I’d focused on Web Development work I might have made more formal career progress… or I might have bored out.</p>

<p>As usual this issue is not clear-cut. It’s good to have a mix of specialism and general competence, called <a href="https://alexkondov.com/the-t-shaped-engineer/">the T-shaped engineer</a>.</p>

<p>My scattergun approach to learning showed me enough different workplaces to learn that human factors deserved most of my attention. Politics or our own issues dictate a lot of “technical” outcomes.</p>

<p>These days I’ve settled down in the DevOps/Cloud space. My past experience helps – particularly Cybersecurity – but I don’t expect to move into a different technical area soon. I’m more likely to move into management, as these days my learning is mostly about People issues and not Technical ones.</p>

    <p><a href="/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/">On Day 5</a> I saw the Tulip Museum and Body Worlds, had pancakes, rode the tram and wandered a bit. For a few hours I’d considered staying an extra day in Amsterdam, spending most of it sunbathing in Vondelpark, and skipping Hannover. But then the 30°C weather broke and that option became relatively less appealing. Thus today is my last day here, and I wanted to round it out by learning a bit more about Amsterdam itself.

<p>Amsterdam has a lot of sides to it. You could spend a partyish few days smoking weed, partying, walking through the Red Light District and (presumably not in that district) trying to get laid - but, to be honest, that only sounds fun when bringing friends along. You could spend a painful few days visiting the Anne Frank Museum and the like - but I’m mostly leaving that part of history until Berlin. You could spend a chill few days enjoying the architecture, parks, history, museums - and that’s largely what I’ve done.</p>

<h2 id="amsterdam-museum">Amsterdam Museum</h2>

<p>I started out by visiting the <a href="https://www.amsterdammuseum.nl/en">Amsterdam Museum</a>, with permanent exhibits on Amsterdam’s history (independence from Spain, the Golden Age, the building of the canal layout, the Nazi Occupation and 60s/70s counterculture) and temporary exhibits on fascinating bits of culture (Puck and Hans fashion designers.)</p>

<p>I’d love to go back in time and try wearing the below as school uniform.</p>

<p>I’m really quite proud of how I’ve dressed so far this trip. I’ve been overweight for a long time, which naturally means a degree of body image problems. But this trip I’ve been wearing short-sleeves and shorts and it’s been great. It is no longer 35°C outside but 24°C is easily sufficient.</p>

<p>Next I followed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/20/chips-are-down-for-belgian-frites-as-eu-acts-on-chemical">tip from The Guardian</a> and went to <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MjGKSYg1n5k">get some frites.</a></strong> They were indeed very gorgeous, especially with some sort of mayonaise that I picked at random off a list in Dutch.</p>

<h2 id="canal-tour">Canal Tour</h2>

<p>I’ve walked a very long way every day of this trip so far. My feet hurt. Thus I needed something to do sitting down. By pure chance, Amsterdam is a city with canals whose view of the city beats that of the streets. So I went on a canal tour, for €11.</p>

<p>Ooh, the Tulip Museum I visited <a href="/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/">yesterday</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/amsterdam-tulip-museum-tour.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>Aah, the Canal-side Rebuild I saw <a href="/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/">yesterday</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/amsterdam-canalside-rebuild-tour.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>The building in the distance below is <a href="https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl">The National Maritime Museum</a>. I didn’t get a chance to visit but I’m sure it’s amazing given Dutch history and Google reviews.</p>

<p>Towards the end we went near a vast area of modern 10-storey buildings. I think the waterfront has been recently redeveloped.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found myself back in Vondelpark and started to write <a href="/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/">yesterday’s post</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/amsterdam-ducks-again.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>Heading East towards Berlin and Prague, I think I might read the Diary of Anne Frank. I need a new book to read and while I haven’t managed to visit this trip I certainly would in future - but make sure to <a href="http://www.annefrank.org">book online</a> a week or two in advance!</p>

<p>Here’s a bonus picture, as I love the height difference of the black house:</p>

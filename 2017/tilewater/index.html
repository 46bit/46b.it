    <p>Tilewater is a little sandbox game I’ve built in Rust. It’s a sandbox game, where you place roads and buildings and simulated people (<em>sims</em>) live out their lives in the world you’ve built.</p>

<p>Sims arrive by train, move into their <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: green; color: white; font-weight: bold;">houses</span>, visit <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: purple; color: white; font-weight: bold;">general stores</span> for their groceries, visit <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: blue; color: white; font-weight: bold;">saloons</span> to drink and find work, and then work in <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: red; color: white; font-weight: bold;">factories</span>. Play the video to see it in action:</p>

<p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:90.05%;"><iframe width="500" height="294" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z_5WOXicQbc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></p>

<p>It’s still early days and I’ve been experimenting with sims building their own roads, more efficient pathfinding, and properly simulating an economy. The representation of buildings as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1x1</code> squares is something I find cute, and I plan to make them bigger on the inside than the outside similar to <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mods/MagmaMcFry/Factorissimo">Factorissimo</a>.</p>

<p>Tilewater originated out of a bit of ennui. I submitted my dissertation, <strong><a href="https://r.46b.it/timelapse-extrapolation.pdf">Time-lapse Extrapolation</a></strong>, last Tuesday. Getting it done was intense, as those of you who have done degrees no-doubt relate to. In the preceding weekend I’d worked 26 hours solid and then 14 or 16 the next, surrounded by 5 whiteboards and a useful <a href="https://trello.com/b/zybbxNTX/project-sections">Trello board</a>.</p>

<p>Suddenly I had a lot of free time! I slept and cycled and partied and had a great time. I’d been acting like a workaholic since March 22nd, and it takes time to fix that burnout. But after a few days started to feel a bit dissatisfied and aimless. So I took a project idea and ran with it. This time last year was when we started working on <a href="https://github.com/sirpent-team/sirpent-rust">sirpent</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been watching a lot of Westworld lately, and I loved the idea of simulating frontier towns. In practice Tilewater is a long way from that idea, but having bandits run into town might happen in time.</p>

<p>I don’t know how much further I’ll develop Tilewater for the time being - I’ve been enjoying the sunshine and my books a bit more. But provided you’re a little bit technical you can <strong><a href="https://github.com/46bit/tilewater">play Tilewater by following the directions on Github</a></strong>.</p>

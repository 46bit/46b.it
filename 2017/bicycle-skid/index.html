    <p>One of my favourite things about York is how bicyclable it is. I grew up in the countryside but somewhere decidedly not safe to cycle from, so it’s a very welcome change. Aside from a couple of minor things it’s worked fine for the last 5 years. On Friday (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2017-03-10</code>) I had a bit of an accident.

<p>Sam Hand (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sdhand</code>) took the initiative to organise some new <a href="https://www.hacksoc.org">HackSoc</a> movie nights this year, and I’ve been helping with little bits of logistics. I’d been watching Apollo 13 but skipped Moon because I’d seen it recently.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d205.29712955826926!2d-1.0386286637597082!3d53.9533881908245!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e1!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1489358465930" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>It was at this bend on Yarburgh Way that I came off. Rather than my bicycle taking the turn it went over, my head slamming into the road surface and about a dozen different areas of me getting scraped, bruised or hurt. I don’t seem to have any bad injuries… but I’ve found it remarkable how incapacitated very bad scrapes on a knee and forearm can make you.</p>

<p>I’m not particularly sure how it happened. My bicycle completely skidded out as if it had no grip, but it was far too warm for ice and I didn’t see any oil in the immediate aftermath. I have to wonder if my speed was just too high for the grip of the tyres - it’s an exceptionally tight bend.</p>

<p>In any case, I was momentarily aware of the bicycle not moving correctly but then I don’t particularly remember anything until picking part of my bicycle bell off the road. I picked myself off the road after a time and was tremendously dazed for 20 minutes or so. A kind passerby walked with me for a time to check I was okay - I think they were worried about a concussion. Let’s face it: I was worried about a concussion.</p>

<p>Now, Helmets aren’t exactly designed to protect against concussions. The foam is a bit too hard. But they do a good job of protection otherwise, and in this case I think that if the helmet didn’t take it the side of my head would have been in a horrible state - and me probably rather more seriously injured.</p>

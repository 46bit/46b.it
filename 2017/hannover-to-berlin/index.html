    <p>Yesterday I got to Hannover, Germany. I’m here on the way to Berlin, visiting a more realistic, non-capital-city and yet thoroughly pleasant city. <a href="/2017/amsterdam-to-hannover/">Last night</a> I wandered through much of the Old Town and down to the large Maschsee lake. Today I’m visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrenhausen_Gardens">The Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen</a> and hopping back on a Deutsche Bahn ICE train to Berlin.

<h2 id="the-royal-gardens-of-herrenhausen">The Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen</h2>

<p>The gardens are divided into two areas, with half composed of short greenery and the other half of quite tall trees. The best way to show this is a satellite view, so please forgive the size of the Google Map below.</p>

<p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:90.05%;"><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d5965.481180443901!2d9.693881703646845!3d52.38798026606271!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x8aba2eb652d94572!2sHerrenhausen+Gardens!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1498337882836" width="600" height="450" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></p>

<p>To make my 12:31pm train, I got there shortly after it opened at 9am. I seemed to be the second or third visitor of the day, which was great for getting photos without people in them. Access was remarkably easy: Hannover’s main train station and main U-Bahn station are linked by a subterranean shopping mall, and from there it’s an 8 minute journey running every 7 minutes. If you visit, note that the fountains turn on from about 10am.</p>

<p>Statues guarding the front garden remind me of Weeping Angels from Doctor Who…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/hannover-gardens-front.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>Further back there are an assortment of smaller gardens, some with roses and others with more artistic bushes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/hannover-little-garden.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>The rear garden is largely composed of trees. It has an incredibly tall waterfall, which Wikipedia claims can reach 80m high in calm weather.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/hannover-fountains.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>It started to rain at this point, so I tried hiding under a tree while putting on my anorak. This tree turned out be in the spray from the fountain, which was far worse than the rain.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/hannover-fountain-spray.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>The east and west in particular have beautiful geometry from long rows of trees.</p>

<p>The garden is encircled by a small canal. This ornate bridge presumably dates from the original construction.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/hannover-boundary-bridge.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>The original palace was destroyed in WWII. In the early 2000s it was rebuilt (below), and now houses a Museum that I didn’t get to visit - a shame, as I’d have loved to hear more of the history.</p>

<p>I don’t have too much to report for the journey East to Berlin. It rained a lot, the architecture changed but not in a way I could pinpoint until Berlin, and I’m pretty tired.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/dull-near-hannover.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>A little later the rain had become quite intense, the entire window a waterfall.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/writing/rain-near-hannover.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>Things cleared up just in time to see a train carrying BMWs. I suppose it’s an efficient way to get them to port.</p>

<p>Berlin Hauptbahnhof is somewhat more complicated (5 storeys all open plan) than I’d anticipated, and finding where tourist information was to buy a <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-welcome-card">Berlin Welcome Card</a> (3 days of public transport and free/discounted attractions) took some doing.</p>

<p>Something I meant to do throughout this trip was to document the design of everyday buildings and objects. It’s too late to make a good study of that now, but here is the design of Deutsche Bahn departure signs and a U-Bahn station in eastern Berlin.</p>

<p>I have two full days to enjoy Berlin, and I’m rather fatigued. Thus I got dinner at a burger place outside the hotel (<em>hallo! ich möchte einen Cheeseburger und Süßkartoffelpommes, bitte</em>), napped for awhile and then read up on what to do in Berlin. Bye for now!</p>

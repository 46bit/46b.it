  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/building-an-encrypted-drive-with-fuse/">Prototyping an encrypted filesystem with FUSE</a></h2>
  <p>Today I’ve been at a mini-hackday in Liverpool, part of the <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/training-events/national-conference-learning-and-teaching-cyber-security">National Conference for Learning and Teaching in Cyber Security</a>. Day 1 has some cybersecurity competitions, and a team of 3 of us participated in the Software Development stream.</p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of hackdays—between 16 and 20 I won prizes in at least six of them. I picked up a minimal-product/prototyping mindset, but it was hard to keep going afterwards. Over time my enthusiasm waned. The time limits, intensity and limited feedback hindered stretching my boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>This competition seemed quite interesting because writing Cryptography-related software is hard.</strong> It’s hard to start off in the right direction, and easy to screw up later on. As such having professional feedback on an interesting day of work sounded great.</p>

<p>So, <strong>our task was to build encrypted local partitions.</strong> We had to build a system which stored encrypted keys on USB keys. Inserting such a USB key automatically prompted users to authenticate for a particular key. The encrypted volume was then to be used as a virtual drive.</p>

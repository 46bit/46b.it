  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/new-horizons/">New horizons</a></h2>
  <p>I handed in my dissertation two weeks ago. There’s a few things to finish up but the major things I’ve wanted to deliver this year - a cryptanalysis report, an evolutionary computing experiment, my video processing dissertation - are all done. So from my perspective I’m pretty much done and awaiting Graduation come July!</p>

<p>The Masters year was exhausting and I’m a little burned out, so I’m hoping not to rush into anything. I’ve wanted to go travelling in Europe for a few years now but kept finding interesting internships instead. Now between University and what-comes-after I have a natural gap.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/tilewater/">Simulating miniature cities with Tilewater</a></h2>
  <p>Tilewater is a little sandbox game I’ve built in Rust. It’s a sandbox game, where you place roads and buildings and simulated people (<em>sims</em>) live out their lives in the world you’ve built.</p>

<p>Sims arrive by train, move into their <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: green; color: white; font-weight: bold;">houses</span>, visit <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: purple; color: white; font-weight: bold;">general stores</span> for their groceries, visit <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: blue; color: white; font-weight: bold;">saloons</span> to drink and find work, and then work in <span style="padding: 0 6px; background: red; color: white; font-weight: bold;">factories</span>. Play the video to see it in action:</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/wannacrypt-govt-it/">WannaCrypt and Government IT</a></h2>
  <p>WannaCrypt is the malware whose remarkable spread from mass emails to leaping across vulnerable SMB servers has led to major problems for many organisations in the last few days - in particular the NHS. Much has been written about its spread and <a href="https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html">MalwareTech’s heroic but accidental halting of its spread</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The British prime minister, Theresa May, and NHS Digital said they were not aware of any evidence that patient records had been compromised in the attack. May said: “This is not targeted at the NHS, it’s an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would seem to be true. WannaCrypt did not exfiltrate data from SMB shares, merely encrypting it. But this is only true because its motivation was extorting BitCoins. A more strategic attacker could have infiltrated at least as deeply, accessing systems that deal with highly-confidential patient data. This could be used for information, influence, or as a weapon.</p>
